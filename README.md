# Language server for TypeScript/JavaScript

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/6399fffb5ec930dde31cf654b2cd694b56f2233345e2bc0db4.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-typescript)

This is a backend for the [Sourcegraph TypeScript extension](https://github.com/sourcegraph/code-intel-extensions/tree/master/extensions/typescript),
speaking the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) over WebSockets.

It supports editor features such as go-to-definition, hover, and find-references for TypeScript and JavaScript projects,
including support for dependencies and cross-repository code intelligence.

Monitoring is available through OpenTracing (Jaeger) and Prometheus.

## How it works

## Deployment

The server is available as a Docker image `sourcegraph/lang-typescript` from Docker Hub.

### 🔐 Secure deployment 🔐

If you have private code, we recommend deploying the language server behind an
auth proxy (such as the example below using HTTP basic authentication in NGINX), a firewall, or a VPN.

### HTTP basic authentication

You can prevent unauthorized access to the language server by enforcing HTTP basic authentication in nginx, which comes with the sourcegraph/server image. At a high level, you'll create a secret then put it in both the nginx config and in your Sourcegraph global settings so that logged-in users are authenticated when their browser makes requests to the TypeScript language server.

Here's how to set it up:

Create an `.htpasswd` file in the Sourcegraph config directory with one entry:

```
$ htpasswd -c ~/.sourcegraph/config/.htpasswd langserveruser
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user langserveruser
```

Add a location directive the [nginx.conf](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/nginx) that will route requests to the TypeScript language server:

```nginx
...
http {
    ...
    server {
        ...
        location / {
            ...
        }

        location /typescript {
            proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:8080;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";

            auth_basic "basic authentication is required to access the language server";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/sourcegraph/.htpasswd;
        }
    }
}
```

- If you're running the quickstart on Linux, change `host.docker.internal` to the output of `ip addr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'`.
- If you're using [Kubernetes](#using-kubernetes) (e.g. [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph)), change `host.docker.internal` to `lang-typescript`.

Restart the sourcegraph/server container (or nginx deployment if deployed to Kubernetes) to pick up the configuration change.

After deploying the language server, unauthenticated access to `http://localhost:7080/typescript` (or https://sourcegraph.example.com/typescript) should be blocked, but code intelligence should work when you're logged in.

You can always revoke the `PASSWORD` by deleting the `.htpasswd` file and restarting nginx.

### Using Docker

Run the server:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 sourcegraph/lang-typescript
```

You can verify it's up and running with [`ws`](https://github.com/hashrocket/ws):

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/hashrocket/ws
$ ws ws://localhost:8080
>
```

#### TLS in Docker

To enable the use of Websocket with SSL pass the key/certificate pair as environment variables to the docker container.

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e TLS_KEY="$(cat sourcegraph.example.com.key)" -e TLS_CERT="$(cat sourcegraph.example.com.crt)" sourcegraph/lang-typescript
```

To reuse the self-signed certificate created by following the steps [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/nginx#tls-https) add these parameters to the run command above:

```
-e NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/home/node/sourcegraph.example.com.crt -v ~/.sourcegraph/config:/home/node
```

The self signed certificate's `Common Name (CN)` should be the host name of your host. Also make sure you use Websocket with SSL in your Sourcegraph settings to connect to the language server:

```json
"typescript.serverUrl": "wss://localhost:8080"
```

### Authentication proxies and firewalls

Some customers deploy Sourcegraph behind an authentication proxy or firewall. If you do this, we
recommend deploying the language server behind the proxy so that it can issue requests directly to
Sourcegraph without going through the proxy. (Otherwise, you will need to configure the language
server to authenticate through your proxy.) Make sure you set `typescript.sourcegraphUrl` to the URL
that the language server should use to reach Sourcegraph, which is likely different from the URL
that end users use.

### Using Kubernetes

To deploy the language server with Kubernetes, use a deployment like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: lang-typescript
spec:
  replicas: 4 # adjust as needed
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: lang-typescript
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: lang-typescript
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: lang-typescript
          image: sourcegraph/lang-typescript
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: wss
          env:
            # TLS certificate and key to secure the WebSocket connection (optional)
            - name: TLS_CERT
              value: ... your TLS certificate ...
            - name: TLS_KEY
              value: ... your TLS key ...
          # Resources to provision for the server (adjust as needed)
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: '4'
              memory: 5Gi
            requests:
              cpu: 500m
              memory: 2Gi
          # Probes the server periodically to see if it is healthy
          livenessProbe:
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            tcpSocket:
              port: wss
            timeoutSeconds: 5
          readinessProbe:
            tcpSocket:
              port: wss
```

With a corresponding service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: lang-typescript
    deploy: lang-typescript
  name: lang-typescript
spec:
  ports:
    - name: wss
      port: 443
      targetPort: wss
  selector:
    app: lang-typescript
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### TLS

To enable TLS, set the `TLS_KEY` and `TLS_CERT` environment variables. TLS optional but **strongly recommended** for production deployments.

#### Enabling OpenTracing

The server can report spans through OpenTracing to diagnose issues.
If the environment variable `JAEGER_DISABLED` is not set,
the server will send tracing data to a Jaeger agent (by default `localhost:6832`).

Tracing can be further configured through [environment variables](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-node#environment-variables). Example:

```diff
  env:
+   - name: JAEGER_AGENT_HOST
+     value: my-jaeger-agent
```

#### Enabling Prometheus metrics

The server exposes metrics on port 6060 that can be scraped by Prometheus.

#### Improving performance with an SSD

To improve performance of dependency installation, the server can be configured to use a mounted SSD at a given directory by setting the `CACHE_DIR` environment variable. The instructions for how to mount a SSD depend on your deployment environment.

1. Add a volume for the mount path of the SSD:

   ```diff
     spec:
   + volumes:
   +   - hostPath:
   +       path: /path/to/mounted/ssd
   +     name: cache-ssd
   ```

   For example, Google Cloud Platform mounts the first SSD disk to `/mnt/disks/ssd0`.

2. Add a volume mount to the container spec:

   ```diff
     image: sourcegraph/lang-typescript
   + volumeMounts:
   +   - mountPath: /mnt/cache
   +     name: cache-ssd
   ```

3. Tell the language server to use the mount as the root for temporary directories:

   ```diff
     env:
   +   - name: CACHE_DIR
   +     value: /mnt/cache
   ```

#### Improving performance with an npm registry proxy

To further speed up dependency installation, all npm registry requests can be proxied through a cache running on the same node.

Example deployment for Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: npm-proxy
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 10
  replicas: 1
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: npm-proxy
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: sourcegraph/npm-proxy:latest
          name: npm-proxy
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: '1'
              memory: 1Gi
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /cache
              name: npm-proxy-cache
      volumes:
        - name: npm-proxy-cache
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: npm-proxy
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: default
  name: npm-proxy
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: npm-proxy
  name: npm-proxy
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      targetPort: http
  selector:
    app: npm-proxy
  type: ClusterIP
```

Then define a `.yarnrc` as a config map that points to the proxy:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  .yarnrc: |
    # THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
    # yarn lockfile v1


    https-proxy "http://npm-proxy:8080"
    proxy "http://npm-proxy:8080"
    strict-ssl false
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: yarn-config
```

and mount it into the container:

```diff
  name: lang-typescript
+ volumeMounts:
+  - mountPath: /yarn-config
+    name: yarn-config
```

```diff
  spec:
+   volumes:
+     - configMap:
+         name: yarn-config
+       name: yarn-config
```

## Support for dependencies on private packages and git repositories

Dependencies on private npm packages and private registries is supported by setting the `typescript.npmrc` setting.
It contains the same key/value settings as your `.npmrc` file in your home folder, and therefor supports the same scoping to registries and package scopes.
See https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#config-settings for more information on what is possible to configure in `.npmrc`.

Example:

```json
"typescript.npmrc": {
  "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken": "asfdh21e-1234-asdn-123v-1234asdb2"
}
```

For dependencies on private git repositories, mount an SSH key into `~/.ssh`.

## Contributing

You need NodeJS >=11.1.0 and yarn installed.

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Build the extension and the server
yarn run build
```
